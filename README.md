# TEAM-4-student-showcase

One place to show your abilities and achieve your dream destinations .

Description:-
We kept the Fanshawe College brand and theme by keeping red and grey-ish-white colours for the text, and also utilizing the Fanshawe College logo, with a black background. On the top, we made a nav section with white coloured text, and the Fanshawe College logo to the left of it. Underneath, is where we introduce Fanshawe Collegeâ€™s Interactive Media Designs program, presenting Industry Night below, with information about Industry Night as a whole and different things you can expect to see and/or do there. Afterwards, you can see a photo of the previous years of Industry Night, with some venue options below and a few more photos to follow & a video which we made in Premiere Pro. Following the video, are Testimonials from the past Industry Nights, & the portfolios of the four team members which are talking about who they are and what they did to contribute to the project. Below is a footer, with different links that go to different sections of the website, and a follow us section.
